  <h1>The Landscape</h1>
  <p>Look around and see what's happening. Chances are you'll notice the bank failures, inflation, wars, devestation, and an increasing number of "we're living in a simulation" comments.</p>
  <p>You might be worried or scared or angry. This is a broken world and there is truly only One who can save us all, but this is to talk about Bitcoin.</p>
  <p>There are many types of people watching Bitcoin ... maxis, plebs, orange pillers, people who seek fame and fortune ... <em>you</em> should be watching Bitcoin.</p>

  <h1>Why?</h1>
  <p>Society based on money, getting rich, being successful ... these are worldly things and the wealth of the world in US Dollars is within the hands of only a few. Wouldn't it be something if people could just live in peace with each other? A debt jubilee and then some small sliver of joy.</p>
  <p>Put aside your assumptions, pre-conceived opinions, and systemic beliefs - just for a moment. So much is happening in the world, are you aware? Use your own intellect and judgement - don't be a sheep.</p>

  <p>Many things are connected ...</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Softwar - <a target="_blank" href="https://a.co/d/9QLE829">Buy It</a></li>
    <li>World Economic Forum</li>
    <li>The Dollar Endgame - <a target="_blank" href="https://thedollarendgame.com">Read About It</a></li>
    <li>Banks failing - look in the news. It's happening NOW.</li>
    <li>Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) - these will be used to woo in the masses, to "save the day". They're not good. Listen to people who speak against this idea.</li>
    <li>Uncontrolled worldwide debt</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The list can continue. Take a small amount of time to consider these things for yourself, your family, your friends, your co-workers ... the world population looking for hope on the planet (Jesus is the ultimate hope!).</p>

  <h1>Listen ...</h1>
  
  <p>Many, many smart people are writing about Bitcoin and related topics. Listen for the signals through the immense amount of noise.</p>
  <p>I do not represent anyone. You should be listening to these people and others. It would be a disservice to humanity if their names were not shared, and their ideas not considered. The ideas are "out there" perhaps, uncomfortable for you to believe, but altogether ... how can you not?</p>
  <p>These wonderful people don't know me and they're all from different walks of life, probably disagree with each other on some things, and are all tired of the same nonsense that has been happening for a lifetime.</p>
  <p>Put down TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, Twitch, whatever it is ... wake up! Give 15 minutes to these folks and you'll be sucked in. Learn from history. Learn from current events.</p>
